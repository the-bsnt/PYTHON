Iterator

An iterator is an object that provides a way to access elements of a container sequentially.
This is an object that allows you to iterate upon the elements of a list sequentially.


It remembers its current position and 
returns the next element when you call its next() method.

Key characteristics of iterators:

->  Implements the __next__() method to access next element.
->  Returns the next item in the sequence when next() is called.
->  Raises a StopIteration exception when there are no more items.
