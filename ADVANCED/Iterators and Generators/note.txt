difference between iterated over and iterated upon\

Iterated Over
Focuses on the data structure or sequence being processed.
Implies going through each element of the sequence.   
Example:

"We iterated over the list of numbers to find the largest value."
Iterated Upon
Focuses on the action or process being repeated.
Implies performing an operation on each element of the sequence.
Example:

"The function iterates upon each character in the string to count vowels."
In essence:

Iterated over highlights the data being traversed.
Iterated upon emphasizes the action performed on the data.
